50 States Travel App

In this application, I created a simple travel app that tracks and saves users visited states within United States. User's have the option to view, edit, or add a State they have visited. I've added few additional features where When users click on a map of a desired State, users are able to visit that State page where it would display where that state is. When viewing that State map page, there are few, the page will also say if you have visited that state or not based on what State you've checked. At the bottom of each page, users can click on one of the links that would redirect them back to home page, or take them to all visited states users have visited, and or about this site. 


This app is made with the Vue framework, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and additional tools for fetching state locations data our API stores all 51 States and their coordinates and leaflet maps based on the state chosen to set the zoom.
